#Fantasy Bits

Fantasy Bits (FB) are tokens that get created based on NFL player events.  Each FB is owned by a single Fantasy Name. FB can be transferred by transactions in the underlying Proof-of-Stake block chain.    

FBs are awarded based on:

1. weekly fantasy point projections 
2. player meta-data projections
3. stats and data contributors.
4. transactions fees for block forging

##Fantasy point projections
FBs are generated for each real fantasy point earned by an NFL player during the Fantasy Season. A generation and distribution algorithm determines the number of bits to generate and the names to distribute them to.

The algorithm awards more bits to those with projections that were closest to actual points.
